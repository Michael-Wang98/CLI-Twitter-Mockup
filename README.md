# CLI-Twitter-Mockup

This Python project allows a user to query and interface with a SQL database using a Python Command Line Interface. This project contains a SQL script which generates a SQL database constructed using real Twitter data including several thousand tweets sourced from a public database at: https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment and user profiles sourced from: https://data.world/data-society/twitter-user-data which can be interacted with using this project.

## Installation

Clone the directory. Edit TwitterInterface.py by inputting your MySQL database credentials on lines 100-101. Start a MySQL instance and run the tweets.sql script to generate the database. Run the TwitterInterface.py program in order to connect to and interact with the database. The program will request a username to represent who is signing onto the social media platform. Any username from within the users database is valid (e.g. 2v). For a more detailed explanation please examine the comments in the code.
